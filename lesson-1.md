# Lesson 1

## Hello World

Following in the footsteps of what is pretty much the greatest programming book
ever, K&R's _The C Programming Language_, we are going to begin with a simple
Hello World script in Perl.


```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# Prints "Hello World" to the screen
print "Hello World\n";
```
